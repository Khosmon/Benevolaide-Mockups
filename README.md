# Benevolaide Project

## Benevolaide Mockups

This project only contains client-side code like HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. Some tools (like web browsers) doesn't support calls to files://, thus, to make the mockup works correclty, you can setup it in a server environment like easyPHP, WAMP, apache.
